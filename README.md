Team 4 Project Fork

Project: Time Clock

This project was produced as a team project for CS310 (Software Engineering) at Jacksonville State University, 
under Professor Snellen.

Collaborators include: Aashaya Aryal, Jakob Skipper, William Hicks, Caleb Watts, James Highfield, Kevin Navarrete

The direct goal of this project is to implement a timeclock program, as one would utilize in a workplace. A backlog of product
features was presented to each team, and initially included features such as a badge system for employees, and the ability to 
calculate time accrued, as well as account for shift times, including breaks. 

The project also served to demonstrate and practice Scrum principles, with the project developed over several periods of 
two-week long sprints. To further illustrate the Agile process, new features were requested and added to the backlog as development
continued. 

After the students had become accustomed to using Github, such as pushing, forking, cloning, and more, Dr. Snellen had the students assigned to 5 to 6 different groups, each group hosting around 6 students. Soon after, the professor wanted each group to fork one of his repositories which we will all be focusing on for the rest of the semester. The situation we were acting is that we (the students) are given a project from our boss (professor), who explains what our client expects  to have ranging from functions to implementations similar to an employee clock-in machine. The professor would provide initial functions from a backlog to first implement so that the students can get a good understanding of later functions, which would be added from time to time as groups would complete functions waiting for more. But the overall goal, or what we are graded for, isn't to fully complete the project. The professor is evaluating how well we practice the scrum process during our work.

For a quick overview of the scrum process we practiced, we started each sprint with sprint planning. During this time, we first determine and plan out what we will be focusing on during the sprint, whether it's to fully implement a new function, revise a function that still had bugs, or other objectives we need to begin. Next, we begin to sprint execution, which is where we start working on the assignments we are focusing on from the sprint planning. Dividing the work went pretty smoothly for us, as each person in our group was assigned with one function, although there can also be two working one together. But we still would communicate with each other to provide help. At the end of the sprint, we would then finish with the sprint review. During this time, we would show our boss where we were with the progress of the client's program. We cover the functions we had completed, discuss about some issues we have, and decide what our next sprint would focus on, which leads to our sprint retrospective. During sprint retrospective, the development group (the students) would discuss about how their scrum process went during the sprint. We talk about different subjects like what problems we had, some improvements we can do with communication, and then adjust for how he would approach the project for the next sprint.

Although I won't be ablt to dicsuss the who project, one of the parts in which contributed to was the DAOUtility.java under the source in our project.
